# SCS2024_G15
Group project for the simulation of complex systems course at chalmers in 2024

Forest ecosystems have become increasingly vulnerable to diseases and pests in recent years, posing significant ecological and economic challenges. 
The loss of forests impacts biodiversity by reducing wildlife habitats, while also threatening the sustainable supply of wood, a critical resource for construction and other industries.

Our project aims to investigate the dynamics of disease and pest outbreaks in forests through simulations. 
Specifically, we will model common scenarios such as fungal infections, using a graph-based representation of root systems, and beetle infestations, employing an adapted lattice model inspired by the lecture.

As an initial step, we will model a simplified forest with a single tree species and one type of disease, drawing inspiration from the forest fire simulation discussed in the lecture (chapter 3).
In subsequent stages, we aim to explore how the presence of multiple tree species influences the overall stability of the forest ecosystem. 
Further possibilities of our models are the introduction of other diseases.


## Report draft feedback:

 - Add an abstract (Anyone)

# Introduction

 - Clearly state the research question in the introduction and what the purpose of the study is (Brian)

 - Include: how have other people modeled this problem, and how are we contributing to this (Brian)

# Method

 - motivate choice of models (choice of forest configurations etc) (Marike)

 - Figures: increase the font size / process plots (Megan)

# Disease modeling
 - Add formula from reference paper to disease modeling section (Zishan)
   
 - State specific values of parameters in disease model (e.g. at what age does the tree go from "young" to "old", aka when does the radius expand) (Zishan)

# Discussion

 - First part of discussion: describes figures, should be in “results” (Herman)

 - Make clear: how are the conclusions are subject to the parameters


 - Proof read (so that writing styles match), okay to edit others text (Anyone)
